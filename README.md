Seamless is an ongoing project on integrating numerous creative arts through embedded systems and materials science. The first iteration, supported by a grant by The Sachs Program for Arts Innovation, was to combine music and art. 

We used two methods: PWM/FFT and analog filters, both of which work with a plugged-in iPhone and speakers to create smooth interactions between audio, transducers and smart materials.
